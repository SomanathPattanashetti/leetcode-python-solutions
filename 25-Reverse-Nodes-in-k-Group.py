# Leetcode Problem: 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group
# Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/
# Difficulty: Hard
# Tags: Linked List

# âœ… Approach:
# Reverse nodes in groups of 'k' while preserving the rest if less than 'k':
# - Step 1: Check if there are at least 'k' nodes left; if not, leave them as is.
# - Step 2: Reverse the next 'k' nodes.
# - Step 3: Connect the reversed group to the previously processed group.
# - Step 4: Repeat until the end of the list.

            newHead = ptr
            ptr = nextNode

# ðŸ§  Example:
# Input: head = 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 4 â†’ 5, k = 2
# Group 1: (1,2) â†’ reversed to (2,1)
# Group 2: (3,4) â†’ reversed to (4,3)
# Remaining: (5) â†’ less than k, stays same
# Output: 2 â†’ 1 â†’ 4 â†’ 3 â†’ 5
