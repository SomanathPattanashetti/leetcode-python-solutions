# 🧠 LeetCode Python Solutions by Problem Number

Welcome to my **LeetCode Python Solutions** repository!  
I’m uploading clean, well-commented solutions for each problem by their **problem number** (e.g., `1-two-sum.py`, `15-3sum.py`).

This is part of my **daily DSA practice** for improving problem-solving skills and preparing for interviews.

## 📁 File Naming Convention

- Each file is named like:  
  `ProblemNumber-ProblemName.py`

  Example:
  - `1-two-sum.py`
  - `15-3sum.py`
  - `20-valid-parentheses.py`
