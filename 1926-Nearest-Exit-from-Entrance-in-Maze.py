# Leetcode Problem: 1926. Nearest Exit from Entrance in Maze
# Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/nearest-exit-from-entrance-in-maze/
# Difficulty: Medium
# Tags: Matrix, BFS, Queue

# âœ… Approach:
# Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the nearest exit.
# - Start from the entrance and explore all four directions (up, down, left, right).
# - Keep track of visited cells by marking them as '+' (so we don't revisit).
# - The first time we reach any boundary cell (exit) that is not the entrance itself, return the number of steps.
# - If no exit is found after exploring all possible cells, return -1.

        # Possible directions: right, left, down, up

        m = len(maze)     # Rows
        n = len(maze[0])  # Columns

        while q:
            size = len(q)  # Process level by level (BFS)
            
            for _ in range(size):
                x, y = q.popleft()

                # If current cell is on boundary and not entrance â†’ it's an exit
                if (x, y) != (entrance[0], entrance[1]) and (x == 0 or x == m-1 or y == 0 or y == n-1):
                    return steps

                # Explore all 4 directions
                for dx, dy in dir:
                    nx = x + dx
                    ny = y + dy

                    # Check if neighbor is inside the maze and not visited
                    if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and maze[nx][ny] != '+':
                        q.append((nx, ny))
                        maze[nx][ny] = '+'  # Mark as visited

            steps += 1  # Increase step after processing current layer
        
        # If no exit found
        return -1


# ðŸ§  Example:
# maze = [["+","+",".","+"],
#         [".",".",".","+"],
#         ["+","+","+","."]]
# entrance = [1,0]
#
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The nearest exit is at (0,2) which can be reached in 2 steps.
